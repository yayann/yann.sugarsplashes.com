I recently gave a talk at Laravel Mauritius about Laravel Queues and Horizon, titled "Edge of Horizon: Taming Queue Chaos". The talk covered how to effectively manage and monitor queue jobs in Laravel applications using Laravel Horizon.

## What I Covered

The presentation explored various aspects of working with Laravel queues and Horizon, including:

- Understanding queue fundamentals and when to use them
- Setting up and configuring Laravel Horizon
- Monitoring and managing queue jobs effectively
- Best practices for handling queue failures and retries
- Optimizing queue performance and throughput

## Slides and Demo

You can view the full presentation slides online: [Edge of Horizon slides](https://yayann.github.io/laravel-meetup-queues-horizon/1).

I also created a demo repository for the talk that demonstrates the concepts covered. You can check it out on GitHub: [horizon-playground](https://github.com/yayann/horizon-playground).

## Laravel Mauritius Community

This talk was part of the Laravel Mauritius meetup series, where we bring together developers in Mauritius to share knowledge and experiences with Laravel and modern PHP development. If you're in Mauritius and interested in Laravel, I encourage you to join our community!

Managing queues effectively is crucial for building scalable Laravel applications, and Horizon provides excellent tooling for monitoring and managing your queue infrastructure. If you have questions about queues or Horizon, feel free to reach out!
