## Hello

I'm Yann Labour, a CTO and full-stack engineer with over 17 years of experience building and scaling web applications. I lead technology at [CapStellar](https://www.linkedin.com/company/capstellar/), a VASP operating in the digital assets space, where I oversee platform architecture, engineering strategy, and security.

My work blends system design, software engineering, and cloud-driven automation. I focus on building resilient platforms, improving development workflows, and aligning technology with business outcomes. Throughout my career, I've collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, maintainable solutions across multiple industries.

I'm also an active member of the [Laravel Mauritius](https://www.meetup.com/laravel-mauritius/) community and occasionally give technical talks.

## What I work with

**Backend:** PHP (Laravel ecosystem), Python (FastAPI), Node.js
**Frontend:** Vue.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, TailwindCSS
**Data:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQL Server
**Cloud & DevOps:** Azure (App Service, Container Apps, Functions, DevOps), AWS, Docker, CI/CD
**Systems:** Linux administration, Nginx, HAProxy, container orchestration

## Beyond code

When I'm not building software, I enjoy cooking (Mediterranean and Asian cuisines), reading science fiction (Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Brandon Sanderson), and tinkering with home automation projects.

I'm based in Mauritius.
